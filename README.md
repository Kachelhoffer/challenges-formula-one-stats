# FormulaOneStats

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

This project uses the [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/) API to display a list of formula 1 races and the relevant world champions. YOu can then select a year and retreive additional information about the races of that year. Once a year is selected you will see all the winners of that year and the world champion's winnign races will be highlighted for that relevant year

The app provides a multi laoyout for user experience. You an select between lsit based display and a card based display
